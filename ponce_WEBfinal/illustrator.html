Illustrator was a program I was very unfamiliar with, however, some of the main components were a lot easier to grasp after working with it over and over again. I, personally enjoyed Illustrator and had fun working on the final project. I decided to go little outside my comfort zone and design a creature that I normally would not think about doing, I chose to place an octopus holding on to balloons in the shape of planets because, why not?
