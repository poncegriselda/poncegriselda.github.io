<h2>
    InDesign was a very interesting program for me, although I had had some knowledge of it and itâ€™s capabilities, but never fully emerged myself into it. I took this opportunity to learn other aspects of design that I was not completely comfortable with. I chose to design my postcards with a more minimalistic approach and I think they worked out just fine.
